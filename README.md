# MKS-SERVO42E-57E
MKS SERVO42E/57E_RS485 closed-loop stepper motor is a product independently developed by the Maker Base to meet market demand and in accordance with industrial standards. It has a pulse interface and an RS485 interface, a built-in efficient FOC vector algorithm, and a high-precision encoder. Through position feedback, it effectively prevents the motor from losing steps. It is suitable for small robotic arms, 3D printers, engraving machines, writers, automation products, and e-sports applications.

## Features
1. Support 6 working modes: pulse interface (pulse-pulse, pulse- direction mode), serial interface (open loop, Closed-loop mode);
2. High-performance FOC vector control algorithm, torque, speed, position three-loop control;
3. Support curve acceleration and deceleration, motor start and stop more smoothly;
4. Support relative position and absolute position control mode;
5. Built-in 256-step subdivision interpolation algorithm, motor operation is ultra-quiet and ultra-low vibration;
6. Maximum input pulse frequency 300KHz, maximum speed 3000RPM;
7. Motor angle information is updated in real time (motor enabled or disabled);
8. Support MODBUS-RTU communication protocol;
9. Built-in stall protection function;
10. Quickly restore factory configuration function;
11. High-speed performance is stable, running smoothly, no jitter, and emergency stop is possible;
12. Integrated aluminum alloy shell, effective heat dissipation, motor continuous high current operation is more stable;
13. Provide host computer (open source), STM32/Arduion usage routines

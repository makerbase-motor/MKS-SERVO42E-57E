# MKS-SERVO42E-57E
MKS SERVO42E/57E_RS485/CAN closed-loop stepper motor is a product independently developed by the Maker Base to meet market demand and in accordance with industrial standards. It has a pulse interface and an RS485/CAN interface, a built-in efficient FOC vector algorithm, and a high-precision encoder. Through position feedback, it effectively prevents the motor from losing steps. It is suitable for small robotic arms, 3D printers, engraving machines, writers, automation products, and e-sports applications.

## Features

2. High-performance FOC vector control algorithm, torque, speed, position three-loop control;
3. Support curve acceleration and deceleration, motor start and stop more smoothly;
4. Support single-turn unlimited position zeroing function;
5. Support multi-turn limited position zeroing function;
6. Support direct setting of zero point function;
7. Support relative position and absolute position control mode;
8. Built-in 256-step subdivision interpolation algorithm, the motor runs super quiet and ultra-low vibration;

10. Real-time update of motor angle information (motor enabled or disabled);
11. Built-in stall protection function;
12. Quickly restore factory configuration function;
13. Stable high-speed performance, smooth operation, no jitter, and emergency stop;
14. Integrated aluminum alloy shell, effective heat dissipation, and more stable continuous high-current operation of the motor;
